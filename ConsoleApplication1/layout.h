//! This header file describes a basic API for implementing a hierarchical layout system.
//! A series of nodes are laid out in a tree where each node has a position relative to it's
//! parent. A user should be able to add nodes to this tree and update their positions and
//! then later query the tree for the absolute positions of the various nodes. There are no
//! limits on how deep the tree can be or how many children a given node may have.
//!
//! When implementing this API, feel free to assume that the user isn't going to screw anything
//! up (nodes will only be added to the tree once and only after being initialized, every
//! node in the tree will have a unique name and id). You can also assumed that once a node is
//! added to the tree it will not be removed or moved to a different position in the tree.
//!
//! When considering various designs, please try to satisfy the following criteria in order
//! (from most important to least important)
//! 1) Readable and maintainable. Less code is more.
//! 2) Minimize memory utilization
//! 3) Minimize runtime.
//!
//! You may only use the standard C library.
//!
//! Thanks so much for partipating! Good luck!
